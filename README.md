This is single-page pano-jpg viewer. 

It is based on pannellum library. 

Work done here - put it in one html, which will show jpg file that is dropped on page. 
(pannellum has some example, but it shows fixed single file from the same folder). 

To be used as "windows pano viewer" - since after searching for solution I coudn't find application that would do just that "local pano.jpg file view as sphere".
